				<p id="start" class="article1">In 1962 a band was formed in London and they call themselves The Rolling
				Stones. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards along with Brian Jones started the band.
				They were joined by Dick Taylor on bass, Ian Stewart on keyboard, and Tony 
				Chapman on drums. Taylor and Champan were replace within the year by Bill Wyman
				on bass and Charlie Watts on drums. Ian Stewart was eventually told he was not
				part of the main lineup anymore. In the early years The Stones sang and recorded
				covers of Blues bands. At the time Brian Jones considered himself as the leader
				until Jagger and Richards started writing their own music. Mick and Keith would 
				later be called the Glimmer Twins.</p>
